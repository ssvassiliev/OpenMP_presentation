## Multiply an array by a constant

The simplest problem is applying some function to an array of numbers. An example is multiplying each value by some constant number.

~~~
/* --- File array_multiply.c --- */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	struct timespec ts_start, ts_end;
	int size = 1e8;
	int multiplier = 2;
	int *a, *c;
	int i;
	float time_total;

	/* Allocate memory for arrays */
	a = malloc(size*sizeof(int));
	c = malloc(size*sizeof(int));

	/* Get start time */
	clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_start);

	for (i = 0; i<size; i++) {
		c[i] = multiplier * a[i];
	}
	/* Get end time */
	clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_end);

	time_total = (ts_end.tv_sec - ts_start.tv_sec)*1e9 + \
		     (ts_end.tv_nsec - ts_start.tv_nsec);
	printf("Total time is %f ms\n", time_total/1e6);
}

Turn this program into a parallel program:
~~~
/* --- File array_multiply_omp.c --- */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	struct timespec ts_start, ts_end;
	int size = 1e8;
	int multiplier = 2;
	int *a, *c;
	int i;
	float time_total;

	/* Allocate memory for arrays */
	a = malloc(size*sizeof(int));
	c = malloc(size*sizeof(int));

	/* Get start time */
	clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_start);

#pragma omp parallel for
	for (i = 0; i<size; i++) {
		c[i] = multiplier * a[i];
	}
	/* Get end time */
	clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_end);

	time_total = (ts_end.tv_sec - ts_start.tv_sec)*1e9 + \
		     (ts_end.tv_nsec - ts_start.tv_nsec);
	printf("Total time is %f ms\n", time_total/1e6);
}

{: .challenge}

In this case, the number of iterations around the for loop gets divided across the number of threads available. In order to do this, however, OpenMP needs to know how many iterations there are in the for loop. It also can't change part way through the loops. To ensure this, there are some rules:
* You must not change the value of *size* within one of the iterations.
* You must not use a call to `break()` or `exit()` within the for loop, either. These functions pop you out of the for loop before it is done.

## Summing the values in a matrix

~~~
/* --- File matrix_multiply_omp.c --- */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	struct timespec ts_start, ts_end;
	int size = 1e4;
	int **a, *c, total;
	int i, j;
	float time_total;

	/* Allocate memory */
	c=malloc(size*sizeof(int));
	a=(int**)malloc(size*sizeof(int*));
	for(i=0;i<size;i++)
		a[i]=malloc(size*sizeof(int));

	/* Set the matrix values to 1 */
	for (i=0; i<size; i++) {
		for (j=0; j<size; j++) {
			a[i][j] = 1;
		}
	}

	/* Zero the accumulator */
	for (i=0; i<size; i++) {
		c[i] = 0;
	}
	total = 0;

	clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_start);

#pragma omp parallel for
	for (i = 0; i<size; i++) {
		for (j=0; j<size; j++) {
			c[i] += a[i][j];
		}
	}

	for (i=0; i<size; i++) {
		total += c[i];
	}

	clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_end);
	time_total = (ts_end.tv_sec - ts_start.tv_sec)*1e9 + \
		     (ts_end.tv_nsec - ts_start.tv_nsec);
	printf("Total is %d, time is %f ms\n", total, time_total/1e6);

## Data Dependencies

> ## Definition
> If two statements read or write the same memory location, and at least one
> of the statements writes that memory location, then there is a *data dependency* on that memory location between the two statements.
{: .callout}

_If there is a data dependency between two statements, then the order in which those statements are executed may affect the output of the program, and hence its correctness._

Consider this loop that computes a cumulative sum:
~~~
for ( i=2; i<N; i=i+1 ) {
    a[i] = a[i] + a[i-1];
}
~~~
{: .source}

If any two iterations didn't happen in the order dictated by the serial code, the results would be wrong.

There are three types of data dependencies:
* Flow dependencies, like the last example, when one statement uses the results of another
* Anti-dependencies, when one statement should write to a location only ''after'' another has read what's there
* Output dependencies, when two statements write to a location, so the result will depend on which one wrote to it last
There's a wikipedia page on data depencies: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dependency>

## Thread-safe functions

- Another important concept is that of a *thread-safe* function.
- A thread-safe function is one which can be called simultaneously by multiple
threads of execution.
- An example of not thread-safe function is generating pseudo-random numbers.

 For more, see [Thread safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_safety).
